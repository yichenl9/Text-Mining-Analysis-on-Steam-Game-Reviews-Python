Seems like every other game you die from some BS hacker who isn\\'t playing the game how it should be played. You need a better reporting system and create a region lock at least for now so you can really fix the problem. Region locks aren\\'t \"xenophobic\" Greene they are necessary to make the gaming experience better for your players who put hundreds of hours into your game. It creates a better gaming community with better communication would reduce lag get a ridicoulus amount of cheaters out of the NA servers and create less stress knowing you are playing on a level playing field.

I know its early access but it feels like the game devs have no idea what they are doing or how to improve the game or work on a bug that has been plagueing the game from the release of early access. You would expect to see improvement week over week especially given the fact they made close to or over half a billion in sales. But that is just not the case. The gameplay feels clunky at best. The graphics nowhere near optimized. And the game is riddled with bugs. And most of these issues have barely improved if at all since early release. Bluehole needs to improve fast or another dev team that knows what the hell they are doing will take up the realistic battle royale mantle. Once I actually see strides made to improve the game in a timely manner instead of just collecting money from the popularity of the game will I change my recommendation of this game.\",\n",

Especially when PUBG itself are just a bunch of very generic props sticked together ESPECIALLY when PUBG themselves start off as a mod to Arma 3 not original content by any mean. And when anyone create a new game that even in the same gerne as them they go balistic with lawsuit and \"talk show\" to try to shut down the competitor instead of making their game better to compete with the other guys. That\\'s not how you improve gaming as a whole you are holding it back instead.Now on to the game itself its buggy its littered with cheater/hacker its laggy its ran like even though it also look like even on a GTX 1070 of all things. The game basically dont evolve at all since the early access day other than guess what the addition of lootboxes and other ways to monetized the player. Now Im not saying that you cant look for more ways to get more money but when that\\'s your sole focus instead of improving the game in almost anyway its a problem. And to top it all off its back to the dev problem again as they dont care at all about the opinion of the player and instead in face of complain they straight up insult the player calling them \"xenophobic\" because they dont want to play with ppl from like half the earth away who have high ping which ruin their experience with the game and concret evidence/statistic of the high amount of hacker over in China which the dev themselves called out in the past? Stop joking around. It also doesnt help that the hardcore fan of the game are all over the place trying their best to defend the game with things some straight up saying \"I dont care if they are wrong I still think PUBG is the best gamer ever\" which only serve to push the dev into an \"Apple mindset\" where they can do whatever wrong they want and everyone would still worship them anyway. So even though I dont like or play any Battle Royale game im kinda glad that alot of players are catching up to their BS and start moving toward Fortnite instead.So with all that said. No I wouldnt recommend the game. Both for their practice and their game itself. If you want to play Battle Royale I honest think you should try something else.

       " 'First off this game was really fun to play with friends and solo. i have put many hours into playing and have had so many great experiences with this game. But this game has MANY problems and downsides that i dont like. With the release of the new desert map i have played less because it is so The loot spawns/drops are god awful and there are not that many small areas to drop unless you go way off to the side of the map. The map is based around sniping which i do like but goodluck playing it withouth a sniper and experience. With the map having big citties/towns it leaves just the good players and the lucky ones to win the first fire fight and the newer players and unlucky players to die withing the first 5 min. The map also has a very annoying glitch in when you first dorp to a location and try to pick up loot it will not go into your inventory also you can not open doors or vault through windows. The old map is realy fun and i enjoy how even and spread out the loot is. There are fun places to drop like school Mili Prision and shelter. and small places to drop near the bottom half of the map. Another big issue with this game is that the lag and frame rate lag is extremely annoying. In the start of the match when every one is dropping in you can land and start rubber banding around trying to find a gun or you can be unlucky and have your parachute glitch out and stand frozen in the middle of the air for 5 10 seconds. Frame rate drops are very common if you dont have a beast computer and wont often be that high I my self have a gtx 1060 and only get 40 50 frames on very low settings. The devs do not do very good optomization updates and i havent experienced any major changes in my framerate since the newest update. (12/30/27) Many people complain about hackers being a big issue where i have only experience 3 with my 432 hours played on NA and AS. The wrost i have experince is guys using wall hacks and aimbot which is not that hard to counter if you are playing squad. Overall i do love this game and will still play with my friends but i do not think it is worth 30$ or worth getting if you have a crappy computer or no one to play with. Edit on (2/3/18) Game is still ing and will not load me fast into matches i am often loading in already in the plane or when the plane is halfway over the map already. Some times when i load in fast i have a glitch where i can only move faceing one direction and the only way to fix that is to restart the game. (3/23/18) game is filled with a lot of hackers and i dont see this game going any where. it was fun when i played and i had a lot of good moments. was worth 30$ but now i wouldnt pay anything more than 10 (7/4/18) I decided to play this game again and it still is but now i would say even worse the menue is sarting to look like a shity mobile game surrounding your menue new skin releases and a new \"battle pass\". i have a gtx 1060 3gb and i7 7700k and this game still doesn not want to run smoothly on my pc recently i have reset my computer because it was clutered and that didnt even help. Still no map selection and the guns they are adding are just reskins of the other guns and so far i have not found any map weapon exclusive guns even tho i havent played much so correct me if im wrong.',\n",

I can run triple A titles (Battlefield 1 COD WW2 or any highly graphical game) at ultra settings 1080p and keep about 70 80 FPS without dropping below 60. The textures loading in are probably the worst experience ever. Having textures loaded in is like gambling about half the games I play the textures aren't loaded in when I drop onto the map. The textures look worse than Playstation 1 graphics that were half and if they don't load in you have to sit outside and wait for the textures to load in and sometimes you really have to wait. Earlier when I was waiting for the textures to load in I was moving around hoping they'd load and I was experiencing FPS less than 5 and a bunch of freezing. Once the textures did decide to load in about 40 players were dead so in the time that I was waiting for my textures to load half the server got wiped.The game developers know how popular their game is and they probably know very well that this game has had optimization problems so instead of fixing it they make a deal with Microsoft to have it ported to Xbox One where the optimization is god awful.

Whether it\\'s Solo\\'s Duo\\'s or Squad\\'s the game still somehow keeps you \"hooked.\" That\\'s about all the good things I can say about the game. Now my problem with the game comes in a couple of ways one of them being CHEATERS. I\\'ve come across several instances where I get randomly killed from a player who is not even near me. For example one such experience occurred while playing Squad\\'s with randoms. My whole team was in a building taking cover yet somehow everyone got killed through the walls from headshots. Since I was confused on how exactly I got murdered through the wall I ended up reviewing the replay. Apparently someone from who knows where shot at \"random\" through MOUNTAINS and through walls killing me and my whole squad. This infuriates me to no end. With this in mind one thing crucial to keep in mind is that these types of experiences always happen with people who are CHINESE. I understand the creator of this game has spoken of such issue but I\\'m sorry the creator isn\\'t doing enough to fix the problem. I see many reviews here demanding a region lock for Chinese players and I\\'m sorry but I have to agree with them. I know it sounds incredibly harsh but I\\'ve had it. Another thing since a massive number of Chinese players are now flooding into the North American server it\\'s almost impossible to find someone who speaks ENGLISH. Whenever I click on the NORTH AMERICAN server I expect players speaking ENGLISH. Seriously the server is named North American but almost no one speaks English. This probably sounds extremely petty but I can\\'t enjoy Duo\\'s or Squad\\'s anymore since I cannot understand a single thing from my teammates. Overall I\\'m going to be supporting the REGION LOCK demand like many others. I know as I\\'ve said before it\\'s harsh but I can\\'t take it anymore.',\n",

       " 'GREAT GAME FOR EARLY ACCESS PROS1. Extremely active and communicative developers. This is vital for an early access game. PUBG is being constantly updated every month. I would speculate that this is one of the major factors in PUBG\\'s success. Other battle royale PvP games are mostly in Early Alpha for years and their devs are too focused on gathering as much money as they can from the current players without making any real development progress on the game PUBG is exactly the opposite.2. Great gameplay concept. No pay to win and no grind to win. Apparels are only cosmetics. The only thing you keep from playing PUBG is your skill. The PvP is thrilling and definitely fun to play with your friends.3. Non toxic community. Simply because there is no chat function. Switch your voice channel to team only and you\\'re good to go. I wouldn\\'t recommend teaming up with strangers because of obvious reasons.4. Highly demanding on teamwork and strategy. You can\\'t just hop off the plane and recklessly run around the map no scoping bozos. You have to plan out your movement very carefully and quickly since time is of the essence. Difficult decisions comes up often especially in squad play (e.g. risk your life to revive your mate or run like hell to safety Kill someone and give out your position to nearby players or stay quiet Deciding your next \\'safe spot\\' etc.) An enjoyable learning curve definitely exists not too steep and not too lean. 5. A shooting game that applies semi realistic weapon recoil bullet travel time and bullet drop is always appreciated.6. Various vehicles weapons weapon mods clothings and equipments are scattered all over the battleground to aid you in your quest of survival. The weapon stats variety amps up the gameplay It can be quite a challenge to engage in a firefight when you got the wrong weapon for the situation.7. Although FPS is not recommended due to limited POV the game supports both FPS and TPS.8. Minor performance improvements can get quite noticeable after several updates. Devs truly are working on the optimization issue. We can look forward towards better performance in the future.CONS1. Currently very performance demanding. The game isn\\'t optimized that well yet and runs on very unstable fps even on high end rigs. The minimum 6 gigs of RAM is an absolute minimum virtual RAMs can\\'t help your 4 gigs RAM PC. In terms of GPU one of my friends that is using a GTX980 is suffering from &lt 30fps and extremely slow loading progress. Another friend with a GTX1060 suffers from fps drops during rain/smoke.The game is still playable on all those mentioned GPUs. I just want you to know that the game is not optimized well. FPS drops crashes and screen freeze will sometimes happen even on high end rigs. It happens randomly I don\\'t measure the frequency.UPDATE Although the game is still quite laggy minor performance improvements are already noticeable after the latest updates. I no longer suffer from fps spikes with my GTX1080.2. Server is lagging badly due to high player base. I would speculate devs didn\\'t expect a huge sale boom and didn\\'t have the resources to support all the players. As an example you were running to cover when under enemy fire. You already reached the cover but 2 seconds later blood spurts out of your chest you fell down to the ground gasping for air as your vision starts to blur. You scream for your squadmate to magically heal your bullet wound by rubbing the grass around you but then...okay you get my point3. Gameplay is monotonous. Similar to CSGO\\'s Competitive and Dota 2 you only have one type of game. The unique experience relies on various encounters with the squad/enemy in game.4. Melee weapons are terribly inaccurate. Aiming also can be a bit off sometimes. Possibly caused by the server lag.5. Controls are terribly not reactive. It takes some miliseconds for the game to recognize LMB/RMB/\\'Use\\' command. Or even failing to recognize the commands at all. It can take three four RMBs to activate the scope. It\\'s kind of annoying when the weapon refuses to shoot when I press LMB because of the input recognition lag. This is a vital issue for a PvP game devs better fix this quickly.As a response to the comments\\' feedback I have to add that my statement about the terrible control is a rare occasion. Generally 1 or 2 key inputs would be recognized. I would say having to press twice is much more common than 3/4 times like I said. But it does often take some miliseconds for the inputs to be recognized. My point is still valid The controls are NOT reactive horrible for a PvP game.6. Vehicles flips too easily and difficult/too unrealistic to drive7. Door and movement bugs seem to be quite prevalent lately. Whenever I move a step ahead the game throws me back 3 4 steps backwards. Seems to be affecting the entire server whenever it happens. Invisible doors also prevent players from entering a building throwing us outdoors whenever we try to enter a building. Similar to fps spikes these happen randomly. Even though this game has many flaws you won\\'t regret buying it. You can expect this from any early access game! The concept of this game is so fun! You all skydive out of a plane (you choose when you eject) that flies across the island. You loot what you can killing anyone you see. As you continue the boundary of the island gets smaller and smaller forcing players to come closer and closer to each other. If you get caught outside the boundary you will start losing health until you die!Overall I give the game 4 stars for the concept \"addictiveness\" etc. not thinking of the server issues.2 or 3 stars out of 5 if we include the server issues.GREAT GAME!',\n",

Aight so I was given this as a gift and I wasn\\'t that much interested in PUBG but I have to play dis game and sheit..cause u know...it was gifted...and I dont wanna dissapoint my friend!...so here we go!Since this game is out of early access I assumed you know...what could go wrong?So check dis out I was told to put a nickname....so I used the one you see now but it rejected dat s%$*...I was like \"FINE! BE LIKE DAT and went all asjakdsfjkdjndkf and it accepted it. Seems I can\\'t change it either so...yeah F #$!Aight anyways I decided to customize my character and went full black man....I changed my mind and wanted to be a woman but i couldnt cause i need this...BP to do so....I guess its true what they say...once you go black u never go back! it\\'s OKAY though so Its time for me to start. Everyone punching each other and no one is dying so I assume we in some hangout and I hear alot of asians talking..I can\\'t say japanese chinese korean or any of that cause I can\\'t understand jack s# $. I immediatly said to myself...I made a mistake...I joined the wrong server! I can\\'t communicate jack but it turns out this is a solo match so its cool. jumped out the plane go in some town...grab S# $ and fight...turns out no one is around so the silence got me all paranoid! All I got was a pistol from all dem towns so I decided to move onto the next....a few minutes later i see my map full red and I dont understand it until I saw explosions from afar coming at me and basically panicked and ran...to get the idea it was like this https //www.youtube.com/watch?v T7xJ Ngq5CUAfter survivng dat crazy S# %...I wondered to myself why there are soo many people fighting just for that chicken dinner and I thought to myself dat chicken dinner must be F #$ing finger licking good right? Maybe it doesn\\'t have those 11 herbs and spices...IT MUST HAVE 22 HERBS AND SPICES! I\\'m dying to find out now...so I continued and found dis warehouse area and I saw a dude and decided to shoot him with mah pistol...the guy looks at me immediatley took shots at me but it missed...then just stared at me and I wondered why he stopped...I started shooting at him but it didnt hit him...I tried to figure out why...I then realize....im shooting behind a chainlink fence and it seems nothing is happening...I was like oh S# #....and ran the f #$ out....at the same time he started blasting at me and I took cover in some rocks.....someone else started shooting at him and I took advantage of dat and left. Took me a while to figure out how to heal myself with dem medkits and I noticed I got an energy drink so I drank it cause my characters gotta be hungry right? Anyways went into another house and I found some grenades and a crowbar and was like..OMG HALf LIFE! but I hear a motorcycle and someone coming in the same house I am in....I was like OH S #$...but I had a crowbar so I ran to him...but I saw dat goddamn assault rifle and panicked and ran back. The other guy started chasing me around the house while trying to figure out how to leave him...but I saw his motorcycle! so I took dat and drove off....he took some shots at me while leaving but HE GOT JACKED BUAHAHAH....anyways...I saw dis electrical coming at me and drove back and I notice it was coming at me fast....I then checked the map and realize the area gets smaller and smaller and those caught outside will get zapped! While I had my motorcycle I was driving off the road and it led me to a hill that made me jump out like a ramp and I hit a pole....then i got stuck to it and was like WTF?!....at least I lived though...WRONG it blew up! and thus ended my life.

Over &amp Out...\",\n",
       " \"With over 400 hours on the game I feel people just starting should get a headsup 1.) SOOOOOOOOOOO many hackers. There are hacks out there right now being advertised that they are undetectable and only $25 and they work!! PUBG knows about this and they do not care. You can report someone for cheating but PUBG does NOTHING about it. 2.) Their nat code needs serious work. Theres no reason I should be shooting at someone who has level 1 gear.. hit them 6 times... they turn around and shoot me once while I have level 2 gear. Doesn't matter the gear their nat code is off. I have videos of me in level 3 gear and getting shot one time and dying after putting a clip into someone with level 1 gear.3.) The vehicle psychics are ridiculous. I've been with this game from the beginning and they have made NO effort to fix the vehicle system. Driving a bike is pretty much suicide as you can hit a pebble in the road and the bike goes flying and you die. They also have a ton of invisible walls around the map that vehicles run into and of course you take damage from. (i.e. like transitioning from grass to a road. ) 4.) They have made adjustments to AFKs however they have missed the most simpliest of fixes for afks.. Don't auto release the parachute. Releasing the parachute should be a manual thing. AFKs won't deploy their chutes and will die on impact. Also... who says I can't release my parachute late to get down first?? If I take a bit of damage who cares.. If i want to get down first and release the chute 50 feet from the ground I should be able to. Taking away the auto deploy of the parachute would solve all the afk problems. Such a simple fix.. missed by the devs. 5.) The server performances have improved however you make 500 million on your game before it's even released the FIRST thing you do is upgrade your hardware.. ANY IT company knows this! Yet they are continuously having server issues that is most liking caused by the overabundance of people playing. Simply upgrading your servers will improve the server performances drastically. (My bachelors in networking tells me this). It will also help with point 2 (the nat code).6.) The third person shooting is off. When holding the right mouse button to third person aim or just freely aiming the aim is off. You have to set the crosshairs to the left of the person in order to hit them. This is due to the POV in the game design. The cursors are off. Even when you have the cursors directly on someone you can see the bullets go through them and hit the wall behind them or whatever. Again this is the NAT code but the fact that the most basic thing for third person (aiming) is off is pretty sad. I appreciate the concept of the game. FPS players and TPS players have been waiting for a game like this for a while. They are so close to being the SERVICE they want however if you are trying to create a SERVICE the most important thing of that service is the CLIENTS you are presenting it to. If it's a piece of crap the clients won't appreciate it and watching the ratings for this game tank the last few months tell me they really need to rethink their gameplan and stop trying to run before you crawl (i.e. tournments NVIDIA intergrations new maps ). Fix the issues before you expand the game. You'll find you'll have more backers. I can't recommend this game at this time.\",\n",

In CSGO the awp for example it would be like only being able to use the awp just you cant use the scope its 100% pointless.2)UAZ. Being one of the vehicles in PUBG its probably going to be laggy right? A bit maybe but when its a damn military van you wouldn't think a small bump would send it flying head over heels would you? This has happened to me and my friends almost more than the bugs in this game.3)Falling damage and cliffs. Falling damage is WAY too muuch in my opinion. There is a small house on a cliff near the military base and getting down the cliff is RIDICULOUS. Fall damage is dumb as you take about a quarter of your health just tripping a few feet and the cliff is only accessible by a single road. No steps no slope just a road where you can get run over easily if there is a car.For these reasons i think this game should get a 6/10\",\n",

Graphics are not that good especially for the performance you get. Needs more optimization Server lag needs to be fixed Some attachments are useless i.e. the 15x scope. It isn't variable and it is way too zoomed in to use. Needs more audio settings like footstep volume and car volume. Needs more Graphic Settings Overall this game is amazing and a lot of fun.

This game started off as a pretty well received game and even though it had lots of glitches in early access lots of them were fixed. However this game was rushed to a version 1.0 release and rushed to be released on console. The game is now full of hackers and laggy servers. The developers no longer care about actual gameplay and instead release 6 gig updates entirely based on cosmetics and tiny bug fixes. This game is currently a horribly optimized mess and i would avoid buying it.If your looking for a battle royale game i would suggest playing either Islands of nyne or Escape from Tarkov they are well balanced have dedicated spray patterns and can easily maintain a stable framerate they also constantly receive new content from the developer and bug fixes as well as not being plagued by hackers.Edit 1 Wow what do you know i'm still playing this heap of game i've played another 250 hours since i wrote this review and if i'm being completely honest the game has not improved. The physics engine in this game is so broken you can literally drive over a bump at 10 km/h and end up doing 4 backflips and blowing up.

Players can choose to play in first person or third person perspective but there's a mode which players are forced to play in first person perspective. I do enjoy the game. It really gives you the excitement that you're looking for and the anxiety during gunfights.Since the game is still in early access there are still some bugs with the server etc but I'm pretty sure the developers will get it fixed soon because it has gotten a lot better than when I first started playing PUBG. A few features will be added soon such as climbing and vaulting. Although the game might sound plain like how it's always the same map 'people might get bored playing after awhile'. I totally disagree with that because so far I've nearly 40 hours of gameplay which I have played hundreds of rounds I never once quitted because I was bored but only due to my bursting eyebags haha.

       " \"So you want to know a bit about battlegrounds before you buy this rather expensive battle royale shooter right?Well I will give you a bit of an insight into the game which might sway your mind about buying this game.Now we have to get past the fact that this is an early access game and has only been given access to the public on steam for 2 months now. So clearly there will still be some mechanics that need to be fixed in the game and I am sure those areas will be addressed as the game gets updated monthly. And yes the game is being updated monthly by it's highly active developers which is a key part of making a great game. This game is like H1Z1 in a way with its same concept of a large open area with weapons and vehicles scattered around and 100+ other players to battle against. There is also a barrier that closes in periodically limiting the area that players on the playing ground can be in. However you still can go past the barrier but it deals damage over time and deals more damage as the game goes on.Now that we've got the kind of blurb of the game out of the way let's get onto the pros and cons of the game so far.(Keep in mind some of these are my own opinions)Pros The game is so thrilling that it brings up your heart rate substantially making it a very intense and exciting game There are loads of weapons to find There is a huge map with tons of houses to loot and new areas to explore Your play style is completely determined by where you drop in the map The developers are updating the game monthly which means there will be new items and fixed bugs every month There is a variety of attachments you can add to your weapons to customise them and get that small advantage over your foes. You have an ability to look round corners to survey the area such as in a house. This stops those pesky shotgun users who hide round corners waiting for their unsuspecting enemies to pass through the door.Cons Aiming can be a little bit finicky sometimes and when you think you hit someone it won't register it. However this is probably being fixed by the developers or is fixed by the time you're reading this. Jumping needs a bit of a rework in game because jumping seems a bit off such as when you try and jump a fence sometimes you make it and sometimes you don't and also you can't jump and move forward Strafing is a major part of PvP combat but the game doesn't really seem to account for strafing and it's hard to avoid fire because you can't sprint left or right and you just slightly move from side to side and you become an easy target. There are a lot of performance issues and network issues due to the amount of players and the amount of servers being used. The game is very performance hungry and will challenge even the best computers. I myself can run the game rather smoothly and my PC is using 16 GB of RAM and the internet says that if you don't have 6 GB of RAM then you won't be able to run it. 6GB would be the minimum and you'd need to have a high level graphics card too such as a NVIDIA GTX 970. Vehicle mishaps are very common and you can be doing very well in game and die to a tiny bump in a field whilst in a vehicle.So overall this game is one of my personal favourites so far. Sure it has its downsides but all games do even after early access but as I said this game has amazing developers who are working hard to fix all the problems the game has so far.The game may be pricey but it's definitely worth it due to its variety of gameplay and heart racing thrills. It will leave you wanting to win so you'll try again and again and again. Thank you for your time. I hope this helped )Update PUBG 1.0 is coming out real soon! Some time in December (Hopefully) Thats with no delays of course.\",\n",

       " 'I really want to love this game man. It does the \"Battle Royale\" formula better than any of it\\'s competition BUT.......CONS... Let me first start by saying the servers for this game are AWFUL. Considering the scale of the game the servers should be powerful enough to handle it right??? No... they run like dog with people lagging all over the place especially during the most important part of the game.. The intial drop. as soon as you get your boots on the ground enter a building and try to pick up a weapon you find yourself SPAMMING F to pick up whatever is in front of you. In addition to having horrible starting combat which consists of whoever has the ier internet wins the fight because on his screen you aren\\'t behind the cover that you were running for. The loot is so horribly random sometimes you find yourself frustrated because you loot an entire building and walk out with a flashbang and the guy next door has a M16 with a 4X and armor. (I\\'m not complaining too much about this but I find myself to always be the unlucky one) Optimize your game I can\\'t believe that they had a tournament for this game in the state that it\\'s in. Sometimes you will load in and your buildings will look like PS1 Graphics and other times your buildings won\\'t even load in and then you will get stuck in a wall. (ps I don\\'t have a bad PC either i7 and a 1080) So I can\\'t even try to comprehend how someone with a bad PC could play this game and the Xbox version of this game is just a ing joke lol. Being able to pick the server you want to play seems like a good idea on paper but in reality it is the worst idea ever. Like I said before the higher the ping the more advantage you have. Chinese players are just running around North American servers Cheese their way around with their high ping. I can\\'t even tell you how many times I\\'ve been killed by players with names like Xhang Ping4354325 or Rihg yao fsade3. Miramar aka the desert map is the best/worst thing to come to the game. The map design is amazing compared to the OG map But everytime I ready up and I pop into the new map I want to leave. It is TOO big for 100 players there are too many points of interest so most of the time you end up maybe getting into a fight midway endgame which makes the matches so long drawn out and boring. Gun balance is a weird topic when it comes to this game because everything seems to be balanced but when you think of it what guns are you drawn to as a player. Most people would say the Kar98k or the M416. This is because these are the safer options unlike the AK or the SKS which boths recoil are just unusable in my opinion. Which leads me to come to the conclusion that some guns need some work to make them more well rounded like the M4 Mini14 and the M16.Pros..

Crouch jumping was something a player had to master to take advantage of now you can just vault (and randomly die at times to a vaulting glitch). Bullet drag makes it impossible to hit shots at +300m consistently especially on moving targets.

The shots are no where near accurate compaired to other third person and First Person games such as ARMA 2 and 3 and quite frankly is very unoptimized for older graphics cards (900 series for Nvidia). What I do like about this game is the fact that there are guns similiar to the real world counter part. The problem that I see with this game as of right now is that there are too much issues with hit registration and if you lag you are pretty much winning from the get go. My advice to people who are wanting to go with a battle royal game go with the one that has been out more which is H1Z1 rather than this one. Again once this game gets fully released (if ever) I will update it as it probably has more bug fixes and tweaks. Public Release Review Not much has changed with this game. Hit Registration is poor and if you don't have internet speeds about the national average in the US expect to die A LOT. Net coding is still garbage and instead of adding new features maybe they the developers should focus on improving their engine instead of this. Don't get me wrong the new map is beautiful and fun but they should have focused on Long Term Support rather than adding new features and making sure that this game was good enough for it to be publicly released. I find that as a consumer that people want to follow trends but like I stated above go with the people who started it first which was ARMA 3 mods and H1Z1. Mini Royal Review Again same issues still horrible net coding and hit regs are still garbage and hackers are still more prevalent than ever instead of fixing the issues BlueHole decided to release DLC and decided to not to fix the unoptimized garbage of a game. No wonder Fortnite Battle Royal is become more popular than this. They actually take time to fix their coding and seeing what the players want.

This would be cool if your bullets ever registered properly.The servers run on average at about 17Hz. In simpler terms that means the server \"refreshes\" 17 times every second to register changes in the game shots impacts movements items collected etc. To put that into perspective most FPS games run between 30 60 CS GO (I believe) runs at 64Hz League of Legends at 30. This isn\\'t even going into the beginning of the match where the high player density forces the servers to deteriorate to an 8Hz refresh rate abysmal by any stretch of the imagination. (Battle(non)sense did a video over this showing the details of this game compared to Fortnite which uses the same game engine and both use Amazon server hosting https //www.youtube.com/watch?v SwZ_NUruGTM).All this translates to Absolutely despicable \"rubberbanding\" that is at times so unbearable it\\'s not even worth playing (http //www.ign.com/videos/2017/12/20/playerunknowns battlegrounds rubber banding is still the biggest problem with pubg on pc skip to about 40 seconds but I\\'m sure you\\'ve seen/heard countless other examples even worse than this one) Shots that were so obviously direct hits not registering being shot when completely behind cover shooting people square in the face with a shotgun yet they live sometimes not even taking a shred of damage (https //www.youtube.com/watch?v XqwhekZdBP4 https //www.youtube.com/watch?v 1KWw8I8dp6M &lt that one is a definitive example) Having to click items/doors multiple times before it registers you picked the item up/opened the door causing you to hover in one position just trying to get a garbage pistol or shotgun (that won\\'t even register the hit) before someone comes up and jumps up and 1 shots you with their fist (logic!)The graphics have been improved tremendously since early access. This game was notoriously unoptimized pushing even the highest tiered systems to their limits on low graphics. Now you\\'ll receive proper performance for your system (graphics wise gameplay wise you\\'re f****ed bud) and running it at a constant 60fps shouldn\\'t be an issue for any mid tier gaming rig.The audio is perhaps not as bad as it could be with long range shots actually sounding long range (you\\'ll see/hear the bullet land on you/near you before you hear the shot itself) and suppressors being semi realistic in that they don\\'t turn your weapon into a subsonic noiseless death machine that can barely be heard from 15 feet away. The biggest issue lies in footsteps because if there are people running around you outside the building you\\'re in or above/below you in the same building you will have NO IDEA where they are because the sounds are just... whack. Even using a surround sound headset will barely help.Yet that is almost an unnoticeable issue when you consider just how atrocious the hit registration and lag issues are with this game.I have held off in throwing stones at this game for the longest time as I knew it was still in early access and likely had a very long way to go. We\\'re now almost a year into development and somehow the gameplay has become worse. At first you will utterly fall in love with this game constantly clicking the play button again even though you knew that your last death was total rubbish. You will happily loot 3 cities and get all the best loot just to get in a 15 second long sniper battle and lose it all just to dust it off and play again. But this game will slowly begin to take its toll on your patience like dealing with a bad partner in a relationship you\\'ll rationalize the negatives focus solely on the unquestionable positives and pretend like there\\'s nothing wrong.Well there\\'s a lot wrong. In the current state of the game it\\'s not worth purchasing. There are a lot of much better more satisfying games that you could spend $30 on. Maybe in a few months when (if) they sort the game breaking issues out and provide steady server tickrates (at a rate higher than the painful 17Hz average) then purchasing it could be worthwhile. Until then Bluehole (PUBG Corp whatever the hell they want to call themselves) have a long LONG way to go still.',\n",

There is not a single reason to play the game like a normal fps or battle royal and I don't mean that in that the game has a special niche gameplay. I mean it has the absolute worst gameplay you'd ever find. There have been times where I will drop with a guy and he will find himself in a safe spot where I have to push him and he will not move for 20 minutes until he is just about to die to the circle. What kind of gameplay is that? And don't get me started on fighting from tree to tree it is the worst experience anyone could ever have just dull boring encounters where every single opposing player is a complete bi . Everyone who tries to play the game normally dies within the first 5 minutes so you'll never find anyone with any resemblance of balls within the last 70 players alive.

I ended up getting it obviously and I think I am addicted. Something about this game just satisfies me so much. While gun balance isn't perfect it feels so rewarding getting a kill. While certain areas have better loot than others I still find myself exploring the map for new places to loot. To some the slower tactical pace of the game is off putting but I love it.

Even when twice in a row I got 2nd in solo almost getting my first win ever (at the time) I didn't get mad. While I find many things great about the game I have experienced as many issues with it as the next guy. Yes optimization isn't the best. Yes I've lagged super hard many times. Yes the game has crashed for me more than once. Remember though this is in early access and as of now hasn't even been out on steam for a week.

Lots has been promised many of which has been fulfilled. No reason to think they won\\'t go to the moon.CONS So I\\'ll divide this into two parts. the game play and the politics. First the gameplay.GAMEPLAY CONS Game is highly unoptimized. If you have anything older than current gen hardware expect to lag every game. There are no \"recommended\" currently because they are still figuring out optimizations but don\\'t hold your breath for something grand.You need a fast harddrive or even SSD to run the game. Loading of the in game environment is highly dependent on the speed of the HDD so if you don\\'t have a fast one expect your buildings not to load. This is majorily game breaking and is the difference between life and death as you struggle to pick up loot.Car physics are awful but doable. Expect to be thrown into the moon if you drive over a small crevice. POLITICS CONS Devs promised there not be microtransactions and it was found out the game will have microtransactions soon. They claim it\\'s for their tournaments but tournaments for an early access game is a poor allocation of resources. Even if it wasn\\'t they still broke their promise.So Playerunknown (PU) is the lead dev behind the game. PU is a massive abuser of his power. He has banned people from twitter and discord for having people disagree with him. He has banned players without evidence or due process. PU has also been in bed with the small streaming community carrying out their ban wish list on \"stream snipers\" without any evidence.',\n",

Cheaters are ruining what is currently the best game I've seen released from 1st or 3rd person shooters ever. 1.5 million cheaters banned and still you find a cheater (duo or squad) or a team (solo) every 2nd game. Some simple solutions 1. Create servers with no battle points. Stop cheaters farming crates. Make crates random drops on these servers at a 1/50 rate for any player who spawns into the game but completely seperate from the position you come or kills ratio. 2. Hire more people to deal with banning. 1.5 million x $30 $45 million you've raked in from cheating bans. That is a hole lot of high school students who could check for cheaters on minimum wage. 3. Region lock. I play in oceania. Not many NZ Aussie or polynesian players. Enough said. 4. Use in game death cam footage to check hackers (still being asked to send videos to prove cheating and teaming when clearly this info is hosted on your servers somewhere). 5. Consider banning IP addresses rather than steam accounts. This is pretty extremem but perhaps will make a difference.\",\n",

Multiple hackers met multiple times over a weak even after reporting found one who i reported 3 times before over the course of three weeks. land with someone and find a machete a level one vest multiple weapon attachements in a 4 building cluster while enemy seems to have looted a smaller and only one building just a few yards off and have level 3 armor helmet M16 SKS with tons of attatchments that should not be possible from one building alone. end up hating life because you got 8 kills and make it to the last 3 but some seems to have x ray vision and can see where you are in a bundle of bushes and heashot you even though i was 9000000000000% sure even superman would have not seen you. people with ungodly aim with a shotgun probably better than shroud and oneshot you with a shotgun across a field far out of the guns logical range even with a choke while he seems to have taken two grenades and 2 shots from an ak with no problem. this list can go on and on but im a salty boi who sucks at anything that is not using my right hand professionally.',\n",

Aim always helps you but luck factor is damn high here because you never know what is gonna be in the next house what loot and who is gonna be inside (except sound is important you can hear other player's moves). Also second important thing is knowing the map and where to go. So if you have good feeling for orientation on the map then this is also a huge plus.Also game currently game has performance issues for now (on my PC FPS can drop easily but my PC isn't very top notch) game is not that very fluid for now. And I think that game should have at least better looking graph (when you see how game is running not that quite good) but hey nothing is perfect and DEVs are gonna soon release 1.0 release of the game so if you ask me I think it's gonna be worth. I mean I just hope DEVs are gonna make game more fluid for lower/middle end PCs.I recommend this for buying because this game has proved already that's it is worth of the time for playing. Positive things Good replayability VERY fun with friends Current map in early access is pretty good designed + more maps to come Game is developing pretty fast in early access patches are coming frequently Grinding BP points (depends of the player but this is something which pulls you forward to play this game more)Negative things Luck factor (random loot finding other players etc) Graph. should look better Random performance issues/fps drops especially on lower/middle end PCs\",\n",

Brendan Greene Lead Dev claims that all custom servers will require a fee to run stating that it\\'s how he had to run his mods back in his Arma 3 days Let alone that this game doesn\\'t even allow real mod support Arma 3 lets you run servers on your own hardware you only paid to rent other people\\'s servers. PUBG gives no choice but to rent a server.3. A heftily priced game which offers essentially one real mode Yet has the audacity to charge for cosmetics have made free means of gaining cosmetics absolutely insignificant and now also charges for a sort of Season Pass which is blatantly derivative off that of Fortnite\\'s yet offers SIGNIFICANTLY less. Furthermore Fortnite has a free version of their BattlePass which offers nearly as much as PUBG\\'s. How bout that?4. Game still runs like 5. To continue from point 3 The publishers have the audacity to attempt to sue other games for \"copying\" the Battle Royale mode even though Game Modes should never be liable to copyright Yet this PUBG mimics so many of the other Royale modes As mentioned with Fortnite\\'s Battle Pass Emotes the new spotting functionality etc.6. And to continue from Point 5 the developers and publisher have so much audacity as if it forgets that the game is virtually asset flip one. It doesn\\'t hide the fact that many of its 3D models were bought from the Unreal Engine store It makes you wonder how much more of the game was outsourced.7. The devs like to parade around how many hackers they\\'ve banned and the effort they put into keeping the game hacker clean yet it\\'s mortifying how much this game is STILL plagued by hacking. Fanboys will parrot how \"it\\'s not that frequent\" Hackers being noticeable in the first place is insufferable I\\'ve yet to encounter a hacker in Fortnite and so many other shooters I used to play. But most importantly you will have your game ruined by some hacker every 6 games. You can still argue that \"it\\'s not a lot\" relatively but it still ruins your day with the game.8. The game is infested with bugs like the pantry of a run down restaurant in Eastern Belarus. Seriously more often than not the game handicaps you being of some bug.People that defend this game religiously will claim I\\'m so Fortnite fanboy like I\\'ve seen so many times before I\\'ve played my far share of Fortnite I have about 40 hours in it compared to my 270h here and I have to say I used to prefer PUBG. I found it a lot more enjoyable. But whilst I play neither now I can only say Fortnite is an objectively better game and it does it for free. You know what look beyond Fortnite go to Realms Royale go to the Darwin Project Go to The Culling even go to Ring Of Elysium!

Vehicle control and iteraction is just a joke. Seeing who is landing near your jump zone is impossible to determine because some players are just stright up invisible so you have no time to adjust your play. Jumping and clearing small obsticles is laughable at best so the basic fundamentals of a shooting game just arent present.

       " 'I\\'ve held off from reviewing this game for as much as I can hoping that all the things wrong with it would get fixed but no dice. This game in its CURRENT state is not worth a recommendation. As with anything there are good and bad points to bring up. To not seem one sided I thought I\\'d list both. Really fun WHEN it works. Playing with friends in either duos or squads is solid. Great teamwork building game. Runs pretty well even on the lowest settings. However there are more negative things with this game currently than positive. The gameplay is laggy. This bothers me as much as it does considering it was pretty decent pre Sanhok update. I expect a \"patch or update\" to be just that and not a step backwards such as this was. Then there is still the issue with hackers. I don\\'t think I\\'ve ever played a game that had more hackers playing than this one. The whole \"banned however many millions of hackers playing\" is not something to be proud of guys. It should not be that easy for millions of people to be hacking. Another thing is the total lack of accurate weapon stats. Dont appreciate it when a game says weapons like shotguns are \"one shot\" within a certain range and when I find myself in those situations with a shotgun its now a 2+ shot scenario. Whereas everyone I go up against almost always one shots me but from futher than \"one shot\" range. Not to mention the shooting through solid obstacles and the game registering a \"hit\". This is something that really irks me considering it shouldn\\'t exist seeing as how no attachments in this game allow for bullet penetration through barricade blocks or solid stairs. Also the vehicles are very one sided as well. Dont like it when I\\'m driving a vehicle (UAZ) and my car is taking a ton of dmg and explodes from one clip of gunfire as i drive by someone who is camping say the edge of the zone. Yet in another game a different person is driving the same vehicle and is driving by and I unload 2 if not 3 clips into their vehicle (because they stopped/turn around) and then it explodes. Basic math says 30 does not equal 60 or 90. I really just hope this game gets fixed. It has great potential. All of which is marred by the fact that making money is the main goal of this company. When really if you focused on fixing all the problems with this game and did so then people would maybe be more inclined to buy one of the many in game purchases you guys keep adding. In its current state however I will not put a single penny into this game.',\n",

       " 'This game is an excellent survival shooter if you aren\\'t playing on a low end machineI might not be the most qualified person to make such review as I don\\'t have much of a history in playing FPS so if you\\'re looking how this compares to something like DayZ or CS GO and such you\\'re probably stoping at the wrong place to read a review. Either way I will do what I can to give my fair and basic evaluation of PLAYERUNKOWN\\'S BATTLEGROUNDS.Pros+ 8 km X 8 km island.+ 100 people. That\\'s a lot. Right?+ Speaking of \"a lot\". This game has a huge playerbase. + Once you die or win it\\'s quick to jump right into another server.+ Loot such as guns and armour and other spawn related items such as cars and boats are generally randomized. So you almost never know what to expect when going to the same building twice. Last game there was a sweet First Aid there last time. Let\\'s go there again this game! Oh nope this time there\\'s a level 1 helmet this game.+ Both singleplayer and multiplayer are equally strong points in this game. Which mean basically it boils down to whether you prefer to fight on island with 99 other players all by yourself or with your buddies.+ So far the crate system is better than half what I\\'ve seen exists out there. It\\'s there merely for cosmetic reasons not weapon or stat atvantages. (or pay to win atvantages if you will)+The shrinking zone circle concept helps give a nice balanced pace to the game. You can still play a good game of being a camper and sniping people. This basically prevents the option of you and people camping at a corner of a map for a long extensive period of time.+ It caters to those with different style of play. I\\'ve already mentioned one on my previous \"pros\" point. If you like to find a house bunk in there and wait to pick off people at a distance. You can do that. If you have a more aggressive style of play where you\\'re almost always on the move. that works too. Like hanging out at the edge of the circle or dead center of it? Yup! That works too! Prefer landing in busy places like School or Millitary Base? Or do you like to land in more rural areas? No problem! I\\'ve seen various play styles people do and they\\'ve won Chicken Dinners all alike!Though it could be because of a bit of luck and skill too that\\'s affecting. I hear occasionally that \"patience\" with the right skill is the key to victory.+ Decent variety of weapons. Unfortunatly I can\\'t say much because I still don\\'t have enough knowledge and experience to say whether the weapon is inherently good or bad or is there some better off in certain situations or does the style of play the player does effects which weapon would be best suited for him/her.+ bullet speed and bullet drops. Which means depending on the distance of your target you you\\'ll have to lead your shots esspiecally if it\\'s a moving target. It\\'s a lovely challenge.+ The physics for the cars in this game can be pretty hilarious sometimes. I\\'m making fabulous memories with some friends because of this. This could be a con for some people but I\\'m making it a pro. Some of my favorite moments is some goofy thing that happens with a car.+ Pretty much everything you do builds up to that insanely intense end game fight. Where everyone goes into try hard mode. Kinda like that feeling you get in Overwatch when the payload is on the final checkpoint and is in Overtime. Lol.+ Now includes First Person Perspective as an alternative option to the standard Third Person Perspective. Widening the range of more players who prefer true FPS games.Cons Not nessesarily a huge biggy but I will mention this The points (BP. You use this to buy crates.) system seems to encourage a rather....passive play. What I mean is that you get rewarded a bunch of points for winning a chicken dinner but the points you get very much pales in comparison what you get when getting kills. Which means your only kill could be the very last kill and you would be getting more points than the person next to you who lost and got 10 kills in the entire game. I might be exaggerating but only by a little if such is the case. The game lacks a system where it puts you in servers with players with same or similar skill levels. This could be a good thing but right now I see it more as a con because I\\'m still somewhat of a noob even after 126 hours. There are some players you face that are just simply beyond your league in headshot skills (It\\'s possible I might be spoiled with games such as Rocket League that has such a system.)Heck I\\'m still trying to familarize myself with all the weapons because bullet speed and bullet drop stats and damage output differ in each gun. Which also leads me to my next point. Lack of practice range mode or ability to customize your own game. Only selected few right now can make their own servers. At the moment your best bet is just watch Youtube video guides and just practice from lots from trial and error. Unoptimized and clunky with some considerablly noticeable bugs. This con is actually pretty huge. Bigger than all my previous cons put toghther. If you\\'re computer\\'s processor and graphics isn\\'t above average you\\'ll easily be experiecing FPS problems to a point it affects your overall ability to play the game skillfully. You will have to crank all your settings to very low and hope you can play something smooth at that level.Mind you the devs have improved it a little since I first bought the game. But they still have work to do and I hope they continue to polish this game up. and because of this major con I don\\'t recommend this game with players with below average gaming machines. And I\\'ll bet this is partly why the overall review rating for this game is suffering a bit.And bugs in this game could be use some work too. Example sometimes I get weird things happening with opening or closing doors. Sometimes I have door closed and it behaves like a open door vise versa.SummaryOverall the moments you get in this game can be more rewarding than other games but also more punishing because you only get one life. That\\'s it. If you die it\\'s all over. You need to start from the beginning again. Not like a tyipical arcade like setting where you just respawn in a few seconds and get a chance to make a comeback. Every desicion you make counts. And because of the higher risks and more on the line that\\'s what makes it more rewarding when you get kills and chicken dinners. But at the cost dealing with fustrating games too. I\\'ve had days with this game where I felt like I was on top of the world then some days that just were utterly fustrating to the point I just wanted to uninstall the game.Even though the frame drops can be a struggle at the end of it all the pros experience in this game outweighs it all for me and is enjoyable enough that I will overlook the issues most of the time.Every game is different even if you\\'re playing the same map over and over again. Giving many hours of replayability. I have a blast with this game! Esspiecally with my friends! One of them whom recommended the game to me! And I don\\'t regret buying it!Thanks for reading my review! )',\n",

The game needs its bugs fixed and the game being this broken at this point in time is absolutely unnaceptable. Lately I have been playing Fortnite more not only because the game is far less buggier but it also ties in with PUBG's 2nd issue. The maps are far too big. If you drop across the map and the safe zone is on the other side good luck getting there without a vehicle. Not only this but its so hard to find players. You spend 30 minutes walking around barren buildings looting then when you get in combat you are not prepared because the monotony wore you down to the point where you aren't even focusing. I know they are adding a new map to fix this but what good is that if there is no map selector? I hate the desert map but Im forced to play on it because there is no way to pick the map I want to play on.

IT is SO prevelant I literally did not listen to the reviews because I thought it was butt hurt kids who were bad but any time you make it to top 10 just be prepared for some chinese scripter kid spinning around with aim snap on your head to kill you. After the 10th time of this happening I just had to write a review who cares if you get called racist pubg it may be time to consider region lock with how often this happens. Its getting pretty ridiculous.\",\n",
       " \"Great game sadly ruined by the immense amount of hackers from Asia. As everyone else has said before this game needs region lock. It is absolutely rediculous the amount of Asian hackers you see on every server but their own. I can't even count how many times I have made it to second place only to watch my death cam see their aim snap onto me while I am still inside a building. This is absolutely destroying a game with so much potential. Until the developers get over their false sense of self rightousness and add region lock it will continue to lose players.\",\n",
       " 'PLAYERUNKNOWN\\'S BATTLEGROUNDS a semi realistic (compared to ARMA series) battle royale gameI\\'ve seen people plays it I\\'ve played the game for a few couple games (mostly solo) and as an early access game this game nails it. Now as in many early access games you\\'ll (almost) never gonna get \"the best experience\" from the game immediately since it\\'s still in early development. But personally I had fun and it\\'s just gonna get even better as incoming patch and updates comes. You may confused as you play your first couple games as the lack of detailed information in the UI that I have to check on the control settings to learn each function of the game which is acceptable in this state of early development so yea not really a game breaking problem really you just have to acknowledge that as you commit to buy an early access products.So the game starts as you drop off a plane to decides where you want to spawn then as you landed loot as many resources as you can to survive among 100 players in the same island. Weapon and the attachements varieties clothings laying around for fashion from painfully drivable Sedan to some Jeeps and even a Buggy (all vehicles are gas fueled so keep an eye on that fuel meter) and other equipments to help you survives easier in the game. There\\'s going to be a circle of electrical waves that\\'s gonna force players to take a walk and say hi with each other as the circles gonna starts from the outer island and gets smaller on each waves within visible range and time limit. It\\'s totally random as it could centered at the corner of the map which is cool.There maybe some bugs and stuffs laying around (rubber banding weird latency spikes car flopping around soo high just from bumping a random rocks or bumps) but it\\'s a lot of fun for me personally again.And for performance you might wanna crank down the graphic settings a bit if you\\'re PC build is below system requirments stated as it\\'s still not greatly improvised in technical performance.As for now that\\'s all I can get from this game I personally recommend this game as in this early access state for players who wanna play a decent battle royale game haven\\'t play much of any other BR games so can\\'t say much about that. But yes this game is still fun and challenging despites the bugs and technical problems for now. Can\\'t wait for the upcoming updates and see where the devs gonna take this game.

Overwatch only had 21 tick servers upon initial release but was quickly upgraded to 63 tick servers due to massive outrage at the poor competitive performance of the 21 tick servers and thats on games that dont need to support 100 players at once.

I think this behavior really demonstrates a level of immaturity in the developers. If someone decides to stream their gameplay online they assume a risk that people will use it for a competitive advantage. Or banning people for using an unintended glitch to their advantage when it occurs. Early Access is effectively a paid beta. If we as customers are supposed to accept that the game is going to have bugs with unintended consequences the developers should accept that too and it\\'s their responsibility to fix those bugs not blame and ban the player for pushing the boundaries of them.

Compared to other battle royale games that are out right now it has just the right blend of gunplay and vehicles so that firefights feel intense and engaging. Despite the problems that are in this game when it works it works so damn well. During Early Access I held off on my complaints because bugs and network issues were things I fully expected.But this isn\\'t Early Access anymore so I\\'m going to treat it as such.I\\'ve played though all the iterations of this game starting from it\\'s Early Access release on Steam until now and I can\\'t deny that there hasn\\'t been significant improvements. They\\'ve reworked the grenade systems vehicles physics and sounds tweaked FPP to a playable level etc. etc. On top of that the jump to the updated Unreal 4 has seen major FPS increases all around and some slightly better visuals. The vaulting system as well as the animation work for character movement is top notch and definitely benefits the variety of gunfights in this game.Now on to the bad which I hate saying there is more than there really should be.Most of these critiques come from my own personal experiences but I feel a large majority of the players in this game would agree with me. Firstly the network/server systems in this game are just not up to the standards they should be for a \"released\" game. Rubberbanding and ping/latency lag between clients is a common occurence and is almost expected to be the cause of death in many cases. For a game developer trying to promote their title as an upcoming E sport is kind of laughable when the online server tickrates can\\'t compete with the likes of CSGO of Dota 2. I can see how it will be more difficult to bring PUBG\\'s servers up to that standard because it\\'s a very different game compared to most E sports but it\\'s still an issue that needs to be addressed.Talking about bugs/glitches most of these are minor when compared to the bigger issues but I can tell it frustrates people enough to the point where they\\'ll make Reddit posts about it so I\\'ll discuss this a little bit. Just recently a patch was released that fixed a collision issue with chain link fences in the game where one side would have no bullet collision (you can shoot thru it) and the other would have collision. Needless to say there are still some chain link fences that haven\\'t been fixed. While this is only one very minor issue among many others (such as models not rendering at long distances or wonky vehicle physics) it\\'s still an issue nonetheless and it does need to be addressed. Not to mention that in terms of the quality of updates and transparency with the community which PUBG Corp/Bluehole have a terrible reputation with making updates that don\\'t entirely fix the problem or make it worse doesn\\'t help in improving that said reputation.And finally I\\'ll try to tackle the controversial topic of cheaters and the as PlayerUnknown himself calls it \"xenophobic\" behavior of the playerbase towards China. This issue is probably the largest by far going off of the massive amounts of hate I see on the Discord servers I play in as well as the attitude of people I\\'ve played with in those Discord servers.I\\'m honestly baffled as to how big this problem has grown in the past couple of months but maybe that\\'s just because most of the online multiplayer games I\\'ve played through Steam always excluded the Chinese playerbase on most accounts. In September of 2017 CSGO saw a release in China through Perfect World and up until then I never realized just how big the Chinese playerbase for games was until then they needed their own version to play on. So it\\'s no wonder that PUBG has been breaking Steam records it\\'s because they\\'re including everyone in the whole world. To put this into some perspective PUBG has the majority of its players from China about 60% or so. Then you look at the amount of hackers that have been banned 1.5 million. Quite the impressive number for a game that\\'s only been around for roughly 1 year considering that again the majority of those hackers come from you guessed it China.I don\\'t hate the Chinese that\\'s not the point of what I\\'m trying to say here. What I will say is that it\\'s stupid as a developer to look at this problem and say that the minority is being \"xenophobic.\" Nobody would have an issue playing with people from other countries if they played fairly and I suppose that\\'s what a system like Battleye is for. But it\\'s pretty clear that Battleye isn\\'t going to be enough if the minority is going to be as vocal as they are about it. People want this game to be better in so many different ways and that\\'s why Steam has as many negative reviews about this game as it does because the minority of the playerbase knows PUBG isn\\'t perfect and that it can be better. I don\\'t see what\\'s holding PUBG Corp/Bluehole back from implementing changes that would improve the game as a whole for the people who actually want this game to get better rather than not really saying/doing anything. That\\'s the same reason I stopped playing CSGO competitively it just felt like the VAC system wasn\\'t enough and Valve wasn\\'t doing much to fix the problem.There\\'s no best solution to this Chinese hacker problem that I can see. Many people want all kinds of things like hardware ID bans region locks ping locks etc. Truthfully I\\'ve only ever played with a legitimate Chinese player once and he was playing with an English speaking friend of his that would translate what he was saying back to the whole squad so we could all still work together. I suppose the fear of splitting up the PUBG playerbase by region locking half of the world to the other or forcing the Chinese to player on their own version of PUBG is that it would look bad by Steam stats since the concurrent player count would be halved (as of writing this PUBG has hit 3 million). Ping lock looks to be the safest solution to this mess and there are many games that do implement this already. Call me xenophobic for saying that but it would improve the experience for many people who want to see this game improve in a meaningful way myself included.Anyway that\\'s pretty much all I have to say about PUBG. Who knows maybe within a couple months we\\'ll see massive improvements/changes blah blah optimism blah. Given Bluehole\\'s track record in the past I doubt it but that could change.Oh and Mr. Greene please bring modding into this game at some point soon at least some modified Unreal Developer Kit for PUBG that we can use to build our own battle royale maps with. You said it yourself you want to find the next \"PlayerUnknown.\" For someone that came from the Arma modding scene to be so heisitant about releasing modding tools for one of the most popular games on Steam the next \"PlayerUnknown\" will never be found by only offering \"custom game\" options that are limited to a simple UI. Heck if you really want to do that take a good long look at the Halo games with their Forge mode and custom game options. Just a suggestion.Alright I\\'m done. Peace ya\\'ll.',\n",

Or any indicator for that matter.Extraneous bullet sounds Good luck figuring out where shots are coming from since you'll hear the shot the bullet flying by and the bullet hitting things around you. Oh and and only the sound of the shot itself will help you determine the flight path since the other two sounds are not in stereo...Other annoying sound bs Between the background sound affects and your insanely loud foodsteps you'll never hear an enemy coming unless you sit motionless. So prepare to be killed by people sitting in silent wait for you around every corner and atop every hill.Tedious inventory management Want to pick up some items? Enjoy picking them up one at a time or opening your inventory and losing all situational awareness. Forget auto collecting or auto equipping items that match your equipped weapon you'll have to open your inventory and manually do it (sorry PUBG Mobile gamers the PC version can't manage that because ???)Slow action mechanics Want to throw a grenade? Well first take a few moments to equip it then prepare to throw it then realize you're throwing it underhanded and take a moment to switch to overhanded. Now press a separate button to cook the grenade. Ok now you can throw it but you'll find that you now have a random throwable equipped in its place and no indication of what it is unless you pause for a moment wait for your hand to come up then squint at it to figure out what it is.Healing sucks Want to heal? Well first learn about the 6 different types of heals and the situations in which to use each. Don't worry you'll have plenty of time to read about them while you spend minutes applying 20 bandages in a row.Pointless graphics If you play on super low graphics enemies that think they're hiding will be visible to you since the folliage won't render on your machine. So playing on higher graphics settings hurts you.Pros The VSS is fun although you will lose most gun battles with it.
